umm i have one more feature in hand. why not plan next moves already when time is very less. i wanna suggest that suppose time is below 1 minute and if engine plans the moves while the clock is running then it will take very much time. so why not plan the next moves based on next possible fens ( like play this if opponent played this). this will make engine super fast. ( but in this situation we'll randomly select the next move from top 5 moves to prevent the detection). this will make the engine fast when running out of time.
